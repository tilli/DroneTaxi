Hello 

This is the Meego Summit Finland 2011 release of Meego Taxi. Theres' about 15 mins to deadline so
here are quick instructions:

BUILD

You'll need:

 - artoolkitplus (2.2)
 - SDL
 - ARDrone SDK 1.5 in home directory with Kate Alhola's patch applied.
This one is the difficult one, as 1.5 is not available anymore and latest
is 1.6. I haven't tested if 1.6 requires the patch. I don't think i have
persmission to distribute the patched version.
See qmake file for hints and good luck.

Artoolkitplus and espeak have been packaged as meego rpm's and will be
in repos shortly.

RUN 

 - you'll need espeak binary to get audio
connect a PS3 gamepad via USB to control using it. We didn't get it to work on
Meego but on Ubuntu laptop it works nicely.

More official and cleaned up release will be done in some git or svn repo after summit, 
so i ask you not to distribute this code yet too much.

The code is originally based on Kate Alhola's mardrone (thanks!) and some references 
to it may still be found.
