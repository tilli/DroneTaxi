A game for AR.Drone and Maemo/Meego/Desktop Linux devices.

here are quick instructions:


 ** BUILD **

You'll need:

 - artoolkitplus (2.2)
 - SDL
 - ARDrone SDK 1.5 in home directory with Kate Alhola's patch applied.

ARDrone SDK is the difficult one, as 1.5 is not available anymore and latest
is 1.6. I haven't tested if 1.6 requires the patch. I don't think i have
persmission to distribute the patched version.

See qmake file for hints and good luck.

Artoolkitplus and espeak have been packaged as meego rpm's and will be
in repos shortly.

 ** RUN **

 - you'll need espeak binary to get audio
connect a PS3 gamepad via USB to control using it. We didn't get it to work on
Meego but on Ubuntu laptop it works nicely.

The code is originally based on Kate Alhola's mardrone (thanks!) and some references 
to it may still be found.
